# Password Locker
#### An application that stores a users passwords, 04/11/2018
#### By **Jeremy Kimotho**
## Description
This is an application that stores a users passwords and can if required, generate a password as well. A user must first make an account, this is how we confirm their credentials. They enter a username and a global password. They will now be able to login and use the password locker. A user once logged in is given a few options to choose, which they will do so with short codes. These options are to display existing contacts they have previously added, enter new password details without generation of a password (they're entering one themselves) or enter new password details with password generation. The details of the password are the site, their username on the pasrticular site, and ofcourse the password.
